              Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is one of the most widely used construction materials across the globe.
              It is manufactured by finely grinding a mixture of limestone, clay, and other minerals, which are then heated in a kiln to form clinker.
              The clinker is cooled and ground with a small amount of gypsum to form OPC.
              <br /><br />
              OPC is highly regarded for its excellent compressive strength, durability, and faster setting time.
              It is available in three standard grades: OPC 33, OPC 43, and OPC 53, each suited for different structural applications.
              <br /><br />
              This page gives you a deep insight into OPC's composition, uses, properties, and why it's trusted by engineers and builders across generations.

          <p>
            OPC is a traditional cement type that has been in use since the early 19th century.
            It derives its name from Portland stone, a building stone found in Dorset, England, due to the similarity in appearance of the final product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three OPC grades differ in their compressive strengths, with OPC 53 offering the highest strength, making it ideal for heavy-duty structural applications.
            OPC 33 and OPC 43 are typically used in masonry work, plastering, and non-load-bearing structures. Thanks to its wide availability and reliable performance, OPC has become a benchmark material in modern civil engineering.

          <ul style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem' }}>
            <li>‚úÖ Excellent early strength gain, ideal for quick construction needs</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Superior bond with steel in reinforced structures</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Higher durability in structures exposed to mechanical stress</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Precise quality control through IS standards (IS: 269:2015)</li>

          <h4 className="fw-semibold mb-3" style={{ color: '#5c2c2c' }}>Durability & Performance</h4>
          <p>
            OPC is designed to last. Its dense microstructure offers great resistance to environmental effects such as water ingress, freeze-thaw cycles, and carbonation.
            This results in longer service life and lower maintenance. High compressive strengths up to 53 MPa ensure robust load-bearing capabilities, suitable for foundations, footings, and high-rise columns.

          <div className="col-md-6">
            <h4 className="fw-semibold mb-3" style={{ color: '#5c2c2c' }}>Compatibility & Mix Ratio</h4>
            <p>
              OPC works well with both manual and automated mixing. It is compatible with standard admixtures used to enhance workability, reduce shrinkage, or speed up setting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Common mix ratios using OPC are 1:2:4 (cement:sand:aggregate) for RCC and 1:3 for plastering. These ratios ensure structural integrity without waste.
            </p>

            <h4 className="fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3" style={{ color: '#5c2c2c' }}>Sustainability & Future of OPC</h4>
            <p>
              Though OPC is energy-intensive to produce, its long life span contributes positively to sustainability by reducing repair and rebuild frequency.
              Manufacturers are now incorporating carbon-reducing processes to make OPC greener.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, hybrid OPC blends and improved curing technologies may reduce the carbon footprint of cement even further while maintaining the performance standards.
